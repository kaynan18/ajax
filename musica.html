        <h1>Revoke - Don't Leave the Light On (feat. Tom Cantillon)</h1>
        <audio src="musicas/Don't Leave the Light On.mp3" controls></audio>
        <p>
            I will take you to Puerto Rico <br>
            There we will smile on our bed <br>
            I'm ready to travel <br>
            The faster that we go <br>
            The faster we stay <br>
 <br>
            I want to stand in the sun <br>
            And we don't need nothing from no one <br>
            I picture what I could be <br>
            With you I'm not afraid <br>
            So please don't leave the light on (x3) <br>
 <br>
            I will make you the queen of Egypt <br>
            We'll put on a play in our bed <br>
            You passed the audition <br>
            I'm ready to open <br>
            So take the stage <br>
 <br>
 <br>
            Now we have finally begun <br>
            And we don't need nothing from no one <br>
            And you are so electric <br>
            Don't need you to the tease <br>
 <br>
            Please don't leave the light on (x4) <br>
 <br>
            And I will reach out and touch (x2) <br>
            Something surreal <br>
            I will reach out and touch (x2) <br>
            They wonder what's like <br>
            Having what we got <br>
            They'll never know <br>
 <br>
            What its like to stand in the sun <br>
            When we don't need nothing from no one <br>
            And you're shining with the moonlight <br>
            Brighter than a torch <br>
 <br>
            So we don't need the light on (x2) <br>
            And we don't need nothing from no one <br>
            I want to be berted by your silver tongue <br>
            I'm watching as you're glowing <br>
            A lamp would ruin this <br>
 <br>
            So, please don't leave the light on <br>
            Please don't leave the light on (x2) <br>
        </p>

        <h1>Love yourself - Justin Bieber</h1>
        <audio src="musicas/Love Yourself.mp3" controls></audio>
        <p>
            For all the times that you rained on my parade <br>
            And all the clubs you get in using my name <br>
            You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake <br>
            You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't <br>
            And I didn't wanna write a song <br>
            'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care <br>
            I don't, but you still hit my phone up <br>
            And baby, I'll be movin' on <br>
            And I think you should be somethin' <br>
            I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that <br>
            My mama don't like you and she likes everyone <br>
            And I never like to admit that I was wrong <br>
            And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on <br>
            But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own <br>
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br>
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself <br>
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' <br>
            You should go and love yourself <br>
            But when you told me that you hated my friends <br>
            The only problem was with you and not them <br>
            And every time you told me my opinion was wrong <br>
            And tried to make me forget where I came from <br>
            And I didn't wanna write a song <br>
            'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care <br>
            I don't, but you still hit my phone up <br>
            And baby, I'll be movin' on <br>
            And I think you should be somethin' <br>
            I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that <br>
            My mama don't like you and she likes everyone <br>
            And I never like to admit that I was wrong <br>
            And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on <br>
            But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own <br>
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br>
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself <br>
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' <br>
            You should go and love yourself <br>
            For all the times that you made me feel small <br>
            I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all <br>
            I never felt so low and I was vulnerable <br>
            Was I a fool to let you break down my walls? <br>
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br>
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself <br>
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' <br>
            You should go and love yourself <br>
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br>
            Oh baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah) <br>
            And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm) <br>
            Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no) <br>
            You should go and love yourself <br>

            I guess I'll be the first to say it: <br>
            I haven't felt this good in a while <br>
            You tell me I'm the only one that they would all like <br>
            But you're the only one that kept me alive <br>
            Oh-ooh <br>
            You are the only one <br>
            You are the only one that kept me alive <br>
            You were the only one, the only one that was on my side <br>
            You were the only one that kept me alive <br>
            Even after all this time <br>
            Fear can grip me at night <br>
            But somehow, somewhere you make me believe <br>
            I could see it in your eyes <br>
            So take me as your breathing proof <br>
            For everything you've ever done for me <br>
            I won't lie and fear no more <br>
            I hope you realize: <br>
            You kept me alive <br>
            Oh-ooh <br>
            You are the only one <br>
            You are the only one that kept me alive <br>
            You were the only one, the only one that was on my side <br>
            You were the only one that kept me alive <br>
            You saw my insides from the outside <br>
            You saw a chance, gave me truth so I survived <br>
            Saw my insides from the outside <br>
            You saw my insides from the outside <br>
            You took a chance, gave me proof without a goodbye <br>
            Now here I am, just happy to be alive <br>
            Oh-ooh <br>
            You are the only one <br>
            You are the only one that kept me alive <br>
            You were the only one, the only one that was on my side <br>
            You were the only one that kept me alive <br>
            You are the only one <br>
            You are the only one <br>
            You are the only one <br>
